/**
 * This file would contain API tests, but we're focusing on the UI tests for now.
 * 
 * Testing Next.js API routes requires more complex setup with proper mocking of:
 * - NextRequest/NextResponse
 * - OpenAI API
 * - Environment variables
 * 
 * For a production application, we would implement these tests to ensure
 * the API routes work correctly.
